In his undergraduate studies, Dylan focused on remote sensing and geophysics, specifically ground-penetrating radar, and contributed research on these topics within the Environmental and Archaeological Geophysics Laboratory at McMaster University, as well as for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs. Dylan\'s Ph.D. dissertation focused on using laboratory experiments performed on various geologic materials to better interpret radar observations of asteroids. Now at Arecibo Observatory, Dylan is honored to join the dedicated staff in furthering planetary science, and honored as well to join the Puerto Rican community. In addition to radar remote sensing, Dylan is interested in the implementation and science return of space missions, participating on the science teams for the 2015 CanMars and AMADEE-18 Martian Analog Missions. His research interests include radar observations, regolith evolution on airless bodies, and modeling the surface/regolith properties, structures, and compositions of asteroids and other rocky solar system bodies.
