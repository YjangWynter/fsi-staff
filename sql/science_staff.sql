In his undergraduate studies, Dylan focused on remote sensing and geophysics, specifically ground-penetrating radar, and contributed research on these topics within the Environmental and Archaeological Geophysics Laboratory at McMaster University, as well as for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs. Dylan\'s Ph.D. dissertation focused on using laboratory experiments performed on various geologic materials to better interpret radar observations of asteroids. Now at Arecibo Observatory, Dylan is honored to join the dedicated staff in furthering planetary science, and honored as well to join the Puerto Rican community. In addition to radar remote sensing, Dylan is interested in the implementation and science return of space missions, participating on the science teams for the 2015 CanMars and AMADEE-18 Martian Analog Missions. His research interests include radar observations, regolith evolution on airless bodies, and modeling the surface/regolith properties, structures, and compositions of asteroids and other rocky solar system bodies.

Thereafter Dr. Lautenbach started in the Department of Optical Soundings at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) at the University of Rostock, Germany to carry out his Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science. During these years and the postdoctoral time at IAP, he participated in diverse scientific research work, including the design and development of a novel mobile scanning Iron lidar; co-supervised and organized a scientific field campaign over several months in the Arctic; and investigated the thermal structure, metal, and ice particles in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere region at different latitudes with lidar and radar instruments. The comparison of all these parameters lead to new and unexpected scientific results. In early 2009, Dr. Lautenbach spent one month at the Arecibo Observatory as a visiting scientist before he took up a Research Associate position in the Atmospheric Physics Group of the University of Adelaide, Australia. The Atmospheric Physics Group constructed a new lidar facility where he participated in the management and coordination of the lidar project, including budget development and leading meetings. In collaboration with the Optics and Photonics Group at the University of Adelaide, a Rayleigh backscatter lidar was designed and commissioned to investigate the middle atmosphere at the Buckland Park. In 2011, Dr. Lautenbach returned to IAP to continue with instrument development and application, as well as.  studying the thermal structure and ice clouds in the Stratosphere and Mesosphere. Since 2015 Dr. Lautenbach is working in the Space and Atmospheric Sciences group of the Arecibo Observatory, first as Senior Research Scientist under SRI International and later as Observatory Scientist under the University of Central Florida.
