Thereafter Dr. Lautenbach started in the Department of Optical Soundings at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) at the University of Rostock, Germany to carry out his Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science. During these years and the postdoctoral time at IAP, he participated in diverse scientific research work, including the design and development of a novel mobile scanning Iron lidar. He has co-supervised and organized a scientific field campaign over several months in the arctic and investigated the thermal structure, metal, and ice particles in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere region at different latitudes with lidar and radar instruments.

The Atmospheric Physics Group constructed a new lidar facility where he participated in the management and coordination of the lidar project, including budget development and leading meetings. In collaboration with the Optics and Photonics Group at the University of Adelaide, a Rayleigh backscatter lidar was designed and commissioned to investigate the middle atmosphere at the Buckland Park. In 2011, Dr. Lautenbach returned to IAP to continue with instrument development and application, as well as studying the thermal structure and ice clouds in the Stratosphere and Mesosphere.
